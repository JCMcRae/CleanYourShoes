			<p>Before you even start to clean a square inch of your shoes,
				you need to have a proper set of tools and products to ensure your
				shoes get the best clean possible. Fortunately, you don't need to
				spend a lot of money to assemble such a kit.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The most basic and easiest kit that gets the job done consists
				of a toothbrush, bowl, small rag or towel, and laundry detergent.
				Some people pour laundry detergent in a smaller bottle or container
				reserved for cleaning shoes. Others mix it with water to have a
				ready made solution in said bottle or container. If you choose to
				have solution made beforehand, it is important to refresh it every
				few cleaning sessions, otherwise it will eventually lose its
				cleaning potency.</p>
			<br>
			<p>For people with suede shoes (or shoes with pieces of suede on
				them), it is good to also include a shoe eraser and a suede brush.
				Since water and suede don't mix, the shoe eraser will get rid of
				marks and dirt from the suede, and the brush will restore its nap.</p>
			<br>
			<p>For quick cleaning sessions that don't require the extensive
				clean, but rather a quick touch-up, some instant shoe cleaner is
				good to have. For the intents and purposes of this website, it is
				not meant to be used as an alternative cleaning method. Although it
				is meant to be used as such, we don't recommend it, as many products
				don't and can't deliver the same clean as the traditional method.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Lastly, some water and/or dirt repellent (commonly referred to
				as "Rain 'N Stain") is also very helpful. This acts as a protective
				coat on your shoes to shield them from the elements and other things
				that may bring dirt and stain to your shoes. These should be applied
				to your shoes right after purchasing them, and after every clean.
				Some products make note that the shoes need to be stored for a few
				hours after applying a coat, so be sure to read the products
				instructions for further details.

				<li>Many brands offer essentials to help build a kit. <a
					class="outsideLink" href="http://www.jasonmarkk.com/">Jason
						Markk</a> offers a ready made solution that need only be mixed with
					water, quick wipes, repellent, and also a brush specially designed for cleaning shoes.
				<li>RESTOCK YOUR KIT! If something is low or used up, replace
					it.
				<li>Keep your kit all together. Get a bag, box, or container
					to keep it all in one place. It sounds trivial, but it saves you time and stress.
