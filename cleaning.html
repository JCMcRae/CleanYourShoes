			<p>Not too long ago, you probably copped some of the hottest
				shoes on the market. Because you are a practical person, you put
				that money to use and you proceed to flex on your family and
				friends, donning your new wares everywhere you go. But over time,
				the elements start to show on your shoes, and the once prized
				posessions of your closet no longer bring you the attention they
				once did. Fortunately for you, you can restore your shoes to a
				degree of their former glory by following these steps to cleaning
				your shoes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Depending on the number of shoes you have or how many you
				decide to clean, the process can take anywhere from 15 minutes to
				several hours. The trade-off, however, is a lifetime of clean shoes
				in great shape and condition.
			<h3 class="subtitle links">Steps</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Fill your bowl about halfway with water. Add anywhere from
					a quarter cup to half a cup of laundry detergent. Stir and mix
					vigorously to create the cleaning soluton.
				<li>Dip toothbrush in the solution and stir. Shake off excess
					water from toothbrush.
				<li>Unlace your shoes, and set aside the shoe laces.
					Instructions for cleaning the shoe laces are detailed later.
				<li>Scrub sections of your shoe with toothbrush and solution.
					Make sure to dip your toothbrush 3-5 times a section to ensure a
					good clean.
					<ul>
						<li>Be Mindful that Suede and water do not get along. For the
							inexperienced, one should have with them a shoe eraser to clean
							parts of suede.</li>
						<li>For those a little more savvy, dip the tip (and we mean
							the absolute tip; your brush is still virtually dry) of your brush's bristles in the solution, and
							scrub across the suede to still give it a clean scrub. The idea
							here is that the solution can work on the suede without the
							discoloration or ruin that water will bring.
					</ul>
				<li>After scrubbing a section or part of your shoe, wipe off
					the excess water and solution with the rag or towel. Finish drying
					off the shoe with the rag.
					<ul>
						<li>If your towel gets to be really dirty or damp, it's best
							to get another towel, as the first towel gets to be less
							effective at cleaning and drying your shoes.
					</ul>
				<li>Shoelaces:
					<ul>
						<li>For cleaning shoelaces, dip the shoe laces in your bowl.
							Squeeze and rub the laces together in the bowl. There are a
							number of ways to do this; think of old fashioned laundry
							cleaning.
						<li>Take the shoe laces out of the bowl, and ring them out
							over the bowl. An easy way to do this is to hold one end of the
							lace, and running your other hand down the lace, ringing it as
							you move down the string.
						<li>hang dry your strings and let them air dry. A good amount
							of time is anywhere from 1-3 hours.
					</ul>
				<li>Re-lace your shoes to your fitting, and then you're done!
			</ol>

			<p class="subtitle links">You Will Need:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A bowl; clear plastic ones preferred
				<li>A tootbrush (that you aren't using to brush your teeth
					with.)
				<li>Liquid Laundry Detergent
				<li>A small towel or rag
				<li>Shoes you want to clean
			</ul>
			<p class="subtitle links">Maintenance Tips:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To keep your shoes the absolute freshest, it is recommended
					that you clean your shoes every week. This guarantees that your
					shoes stay nearly as clean as they day you got them. It is also
					easier to clean them and remove dirt and marks by cleaning them
					consistently, as compared to letting weeks or months of dirt and
					grime build-up.
				<li>To protect your shoes from dirt and rain, visit your local
					shoe store and purchase water and/or stain repellant. This helps
					prevent long lasting stains from liquids and grime that would
					otherwise be difficult to get off of your shoes. Apply these before
					you wear your shoes for the first time, and every time after you
					clean them.
