			<p>So you know how to clean your shoes, but now it's time to make
				sure they stay clean when you aren't wearing them. Just because they
				aren't on your feet doesn't mean they can't accumulate dirt and
				dust. Shoes just laying around your place can accumulate dirt and
				dust, along with stacking them on top of each other or throwing them
				in a pile unprotected. These things can lead to dirt and scuff marks
				from the other shoes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>To preserve your the cleanliness of your shoes, it is a good
				idea to keep them in a box of some sort. Many people keep them in
				their original shoe box. This is a common practice, and while it is
				acceptable, the manufacturer's shoe box is cheap, can be worn down
				and broken very easily. One alternative is to buy a container from
				any local Wal-Mart, Target, Container Store, etc. Plastic box
				containers are inexpensive, sturdy, and last a long time. While one
				size usually does the trick for many shoes, consider getting bigger
				sizes for high tops.

			<p class="subtitle links">Storage Tips:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>While Yellowing is virtually inevitable, you can aid the
					consistent cleaning with storing silica gels in the shoe boxes.
					This helps preserve the whiteness of the shoes (especially the
					soles) for a long time. You should change out the silica gels every
					few months.
				<li>If you don't have boxes or containers to put your shoes in,
					keeping them nice, neat, and lined up in rows in a closet is a
					default and standard option. This means you have to keep your
					closet clean, however. If you aren't a slob, this shouldn't be a
					problem.
				<li>Again, don't stack the shoes if you don't have boxes. The
					dirt from the bottom of shoes is usually a lot nastier and more of
					a hassle to clean off of other shoes, namely the laces.
				<li>Shoe trees are your best friend. They aren't just for your
					dad's dress shoes. We all know that one dude with the raggedy,
					lifeless J's, and we don't want you to be him (or her). Shoe tress
					help keep the form of your shoes, preventing them from looking
					deflated after weeks of wear. You don't need fancy wood ones, you
					can find plastic ones for cheaper that do the trick all the same.
